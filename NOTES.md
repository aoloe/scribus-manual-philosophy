# Notes

- linking to image frames, loading text frames
- creating and using colors
- bold and italics
- RGB, CMYK, input and PDF output
- double pages, left and right masterpages, adding single/double pages
  - arrange pages can be of some help if you have to add a single page...
- master pages as a background (+scrapbook, ...)
- avoid using the "story editor" (ctrl-t) except for the cases where you really need it (double click a text field to enter the edit mode, press esc to leave the edit mode and display the "window > properties" palette for formatting your text)
- ESC key for leaving the current edit mode and go back, step by step, to the original unselected state.
